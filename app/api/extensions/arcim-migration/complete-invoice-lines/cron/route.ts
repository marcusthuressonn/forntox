/**
 * GET /api/extensions/arcim-migration/complete-invoice-lines/cron: fetch the
 * rows (and the VAT split) for migrated sales invoices that were imported
 * without them.
 *
 * The migration hydrates the provider's detail form inside a fixed budget
 * and reports the shortfall; this is what picks the shortfall up. Every run
 * walks the accepted consents whose credentials can still be used, in two
 * phases. First it sizes each register on our side: one indexed count of the
 * invoices still without rows per consent, no provider call. Then it hands
 * the registers with anything left to the pass smallest first, each within
 * its share of the run. Shortest job first: a register that fits its share
 * is finished this run whatever was accepted after it, and a register that
 * needs several runs takes what is left of each instead of pushing every
 * older company back by an hour per run (on 2026-09-05 a 1 125-invoice
 * register on the newest consent used two runs in a row while a 384-invoice
 * register three consents older, about 100 s of work, was skipped for budget
 * both times). Nothing is stored between runs: the counts are taken fresh
 * every hour, so a register the wizard or an earlier run finished simply
 * stops appearing.
 *
 * What a run does not reach is, by construction, its largest registers. They
 * are reported as deferred with their counts in the run summary and in the
 * response, so a register that is deferred hour after hour (possible only
 * while smaller registers keep arriving faster than the run clears them) is
 * visible rather than silent. Scheduled hourly in vercel.json (and the
 * Docker crontabs); a company the size of Clearstoq (1 125 invoices) is done
 * after two or three runs.
 *
 * "Can still be used" is read off the token row, not the consent's age:
 * Fortnox issues a new refresh token on every refresh and each one lives 45
 * days, so a pair whose access token expired more than 45 days ago has not
 * been refreshed since and its refresh token is dead. Trying such a consent
 * every hour would only log the same PROVIDER_AUTH_EXPIRED; when the company
 * reconnects through the wizard, the token row is renewed and the next run
 * finds it here. A token without an expiry (Bokio's private tokens) is
 * always eligible.
