# ISSUES

GitHub issues are provided at start of context. Parse it to get open issues with their bodies and comments.

You will work on the AFK issues only, not the HITL ones.

You've also been passed a file containing the last few commits. Review these to understand what work has been done.

If all AFK tasks are complete, output <promise>NO MORE TASKS</promise>.

# TASK SELECTION

Pick the next task. Prioritize tasks in this order:

1. Critical bugfixes
2. Development infrastructure

Getting development infrastructure like tests and types and dev scripts ready is an important precursor to building features.

3. Tracer bullets for new features

Tracer bullets are small slices of functionality that go through all layers of the system, allowing you to test and validate your approach early. This helps in identifying potential issues and ensures that the overall architecture is sound before investing significant time in development.

TL;DR - build a tiny, end-to-end slice of the feature first, then expand it out.

4. Polish and quick wins
5. Refactors

# EXPLORATION

Explore the repo.

# IMPLEMENTATION

**For backend code**: use red/green/refactor, one test at a time in a tracer-bullet style.

1. Write a single failing test for the smallest vertical slice of behavior
2. Run the test — confirm it fails (red)
3. Write the minimum code to make it pass (green)
4. Repeat from step 1 for the next slice of behavior
5. Refactor if needed while keeping tests green

Each test should target one thin vertical slice through the system. Do not write all tests upfront — write one, make it pass, then move to the next.
**For frontend code**: implement directly without TDD.

# FEEDBACK LOOPS

Before committing, run the feedback loops:

- `pnpm run test` to run the tests
- `pnpm run typecheck` to run the type checker

# COMMIT

Make a git commit. The commit message must:

1. Include key decisions made
2. Include files changed
3. Blockers or notes for next iteration

# THE ISSUE

If the task is complete, close the original GitHub issue.

If the task is not complete, leave a comment on the GitHub issue with what was done.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.
