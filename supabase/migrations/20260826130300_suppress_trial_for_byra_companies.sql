-- Migration: no 30-day trial for byrå-team companies
--
-- White-label billing slice (WL-10 resolution, dev_docs/white-label/):
-- companies created under a byrå team (teams.kind = 'byra') are already
-- entitled via the team-scoped partner grant, so the company-scoped 30-day
-- trial is pure noise there: trial-expiry emails would hit byrå clients with
-- the wrong message. Personal-team and teamless companies keep the trial
-- exactly as shipped in 20260818170000 (the full seven-key PAID set).
--
-- Replaces ONLY the trigger function body (seed_trial_capability_grants);
-- the trigger itself (trg_seed_trial_capability_grants, AFTER INSERT ON
-- companies) is untouched. team_id is populated in the same INSERT on every
-- creation path (create_company_with_owner p_team_id / direct insert), so
-- reading NEW.team_id here is race-free.
